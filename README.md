# Bulls-and-cows
This game is 'Bulls and Cows'. In this game you need guess the numbers which will be generated by computer. You need enter the sequence of digits (from 0 to 9, moreover 0 can place at the beginning of sequence), and computer write bulls' number that means how many right digits (that is in the number) is placed on right positions, and cows' number that means how many right digits is placed on wrong positions.

If the game is crashed, you can tied to kill the process from windows task manager or close one. About problems in games please write me. I will try to solve them.
